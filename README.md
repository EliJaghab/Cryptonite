# Cryptonite
Cryptonite, a program written in Python, makes it easy for users to follow cryptocurrency price information and access news. Investors can easily keep up with current prices, trends, news, and opinions. Cryptoniteâ€™s search engine supports up to five coin entries at a time, into which they can input coins to retrieve data on. The app then compiles data on these coins into a table, displaying the current price, percent change in price, open price, high price, low price, close price, and the volume traded in the day. In addition to the price information, there is also a feature to fetch top recent tweets on the respective coins.

The first window the user will see contains five entry boxes for the user to enter cryptocurrency names or symbols. There is a submit button to retrieve data on valid cryptocurrencies that the user entered. If there are no valid entries, the user will be notified and no window will open.

The window below is what will open, containing price and historic data of the cryptocurrencies that the user entered. In this window there is a news button and a close all button to close down all windows and end the program. The news button brings up a third window containing popular tweets about the cryptocurrency.
